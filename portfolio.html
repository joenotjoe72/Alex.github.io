     <h1> Our project is a storytelling, choose your own adventure game called Gorilla Warfare. It is about raiding a monkey temple to discover the secret banana stash. It has a title screen, and 3 later screenstates which develop the story. The title screen controls a turtle to spell out our title, using a while-loop to create the L’s in Gorilla. The next scene involves encountering a wild Boss Monkey, which updates to the second screenstate after the user inputs “banana.” This second screen involves using a banana to attack the opposing monkey, which activates an iteration loop when the user inputs “pew.” This causes a banana-like projectile (turtle) that both changes size and color after to advance forward, stamping and clearing its previous stamp to make it appear as if it is moving in slow motion.  After the monkey boss is defeated, the user is prompted to proceed to the treasure room by inputting “reward". This opens the final screenstate, congratulating the user for completing Gorilla Warfare and stealing the bananas.
